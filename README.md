All products, images and texts are used from the original site, with permission of the owners.

The project was inspired by my love for sharks and the great projects some of my friends started a few years ago, as well as my interest in JAMstack and headless solutions.

I built one of the first versions of their site with a wordpress premium theme and WooCommerce for a simple shop solution. 
This project now is my take on a modern headless ecommerce solution
