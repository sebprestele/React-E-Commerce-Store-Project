# E-Commerce Shop 
Built with React, Redux & TypeScript
Own CSS with a few components from Material US

Site is deployed on netlify: https://finarts-ecommerce-react-project.netlify.app/ 

Used Commerce.js as Headless Commerce solution to upload and manage products and incoming orders
Used Stripe as payment gateway - Working sandbox payment with any valid Stripe test card
e.g. 42424242424 42/42 424 etc

Home page design inspired by thefinarts.com
All products, images and texts are used from the original site.

The project was inspired by my love for sharks and the great projects some of my friends started a few years ago, as well as my interest in JAMstack and headless solutions.

I built one of the first versions of their site with a wordpress premium theme and WooCommerce for a simple shop solution. 
This project now is my take on a modern headless ecommerce solution 

Still work in progress...

Form validation
Customer account
Improved error handling
Finalize all pages
etc....
