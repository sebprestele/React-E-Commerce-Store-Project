        <p>They are not only a fascinating eye-catcher. </p>
        <p>
          Sharks play a fundamental role in creating a balance in marine
          ecosystems across all oceans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, these beautiful creatures are endangered by human
          activity â€“ around 100 million sharks are killed yearly!{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
